# Satellite-Management-System
We live in an era of rapid growth and change in technology which has brought all the pieces of information arising across the world to our fingertips. We know that up-to-date information is brought to our attention by the great human invention called Satellites, but do we know where these satellites are placed? How far are they placed? Who launched it? Thus it is very important to maintain efficient software to handle information on these Satellites. This application provides information and to access these in a simple way.  
A satellite's information all across the space is brought together in a single platform via a Satellite management system. It gives accurate information about the satellite, its owner, launch date, lifetime etc. This information will be displayed according to the userâ€™s requirement. In brief, the Satellite management system establishes a frictionless approach and eliminates all complexity.
It mainly consists of seven modules. First, the visitor module which stores information regarding the login details of the user. Then we have a Satellite module consisting of its own information, an organization module who owns and releases the satellite, scientists from the organization responsible for the release of satellites. We have a  condition module of satellite i.e. longitude, apogee, perigee, eccentricity, inclination, period etc. Then finally  a rocket module which gives a list of launch vehicles .
Through this application visitors can login and check in all required information regarding satellites and the organizations can update the upcoming releases of satellites using this application.


SCOPE AND IMPORTANCE
Our project aims at Business process automation, i.e We have tried to computerize various processes of our application.
